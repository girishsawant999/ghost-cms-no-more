There are a couple\nof interesting angles to this:\n\nBecause subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as\nregistered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages\ndepending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some\nposts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a\ngreat draw to encourage people to sign up!\n\nGhost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no\npasswords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email\nsubscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site.\nLike magic.\n\nPortal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating\nbutton in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out,\nclicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in,\nclicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their\nname, email, and subscription settings.\n\nThe floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add\nmanual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.\n\nLike this! Sign up here\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you start to grow your registered audience, you'll be able to get a sense of\nwho you're publishing for and where those people are coming from. Best of all:\nYou'll have a straightforward, reliable way to connect with people who enjoy\nyour work.\n\nSocial networks go in and out of fashion all the time. Email addresses are\ntimeless.\n\nGrowing your audience is valuable no matter what type of site you run, but if\nyour content is your business, then you might also be interested in setting up\npremium subscriptions [__GHOST_URL__/sell/].","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566698217201-4bb26f7e02ba?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGhvY2tleXxlbnwwfHx8fDE2MjcxODM2OTU&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"60dd4299e83b0e70d8cf286d","created_at":"2021-06-30T07:01:29.000Z","updated_at":"2021-07-25T03:28:21.000Z","published_at":"2021-06-30T07:02:33.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Germany's world championship gold medal hopes are over after a 2-1 semifinal defeat to Finland in Riga.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-post-fullwidth","canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"60dd429ae83b0e70d8cf289a","uuid":"37caf278-e565-4c59-a38d-e2b4d33425f7","title":"North Korea’s Kim fumes about ‘grave lapses’ in pandemic defences","slug":"north-koreas-kim-fumes-about-grave-lapses-in-pandemic-defences","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/integrations-icons.png\",\"cardWidth\":\"full\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<script src=\\\"https://zapier.com/apps/embed/widget.js?services=Ghost,-shortcm,-hubspot,-sendpulse,-noticeable,-aweber,-icontact,-facebook-pages,-github,-medium,-slack,-mailchimp,-activecampaign,-twitter,-discourse&container,-convertkit,-drip,-airtable=true&limit=5\\\"></script>\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/iawriter-integration.png\",\"width\":2244,\"height\":936}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/integrations/\"]],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's possible to extend your Ghost site and connect it with hundreds of the most popular apps and tools using integrations. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Whether you need to automatically publish new posts on social media, connect your favorite analytics tool, sync your community or embed forms into your content — our \"],[0,[0],1,\"integrations library\"],[0,[],0,\" has got it all covered with hundreds of integration tutorials.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Many integrations are as simple as inserting an embed by pasting a link, or copying a snippet of code directly from an app and pasting it into Ghost.
